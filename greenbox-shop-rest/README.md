# greenbox-shop-rest
This is my first RESTful project that is using Spring and JPA.

This is an online greengrocer's shop. It's an application for local businesses, where the customers can order local and fresh vegetables and fruits with home delivery.

A shop employee can get a summary for all the items they have to acquire to deliver them to the customers.

It is going to be linked with a frontend application further on.
